In an incredibly curious way, I found myself in a playlist that brought about a thousand listens. There's a suspicion that it's an artificially generated playlist, tracking tags on social media and assembling the tracks into a list. This triggered something inside me, and I recalled another service where you promote your tracks not just through playlist curators but also through a social aspect: by listening and leaving comments, you earn points, which you can exchange for the opportunity to submit your track for musicians to critique.
